# AC Power Analyzer – Single-Phase Power Calculator & Visualizer

**A Python-based tool for calculating and visualizing key single-phase AC power quantities**

This project is a mini EEE (Electrical & Electronics Engineering) project that helps analyze single-phase AC circuits by calculating **active power (P)**, **reactive power (Q)**, **apparent power (S)**, **power factor**, and **phase angle**, while also plotting **voltage & current waveforms** and a **phasor diagram**.

Built as a quick, resume-boosting project to demonstrate application of AC circuit theory with programming and data visualization.

## Features

- User-friendly input for RMS voltage, current, power factor, and frequency
- Calculates:
  - Apparent Power (S) in VA
  - Active Power (P) in Watts
  - Reactive Power (Q) in VAR
  - Phase angle in degrees
- Visualizes:
  - Time-domain voltage and current waveforms
  - Phasor diagram (showing voltage and current vectors)
- Provides practical suggestion for low power factor (e.g., capacitor compensation)

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **NumPy** – for numerical calculations and array handling
- **Matplotlib** – for plotting waveforms and phasor diagram

## Installation
